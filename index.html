        <p>
           I am Aadit Kapoor. I love to think of new innovative ideas and most importantly try hard to make them a reality. In addition to that, I am extremely curious.<br>
		I am interested in <b><u>solving technically difficult</u>, <b><u>real world AI problems</u></b>.</b>
		I enjoy solving applied A.I problems that are value-driven and can fundamentally change the way humans live. Additionaly, I love reading and analyzing businesses and companies.
		<br>
           My research areas of interests include: <b>Artificial Intelligence </b>, <b>Machine Learning (A.I/M.L in Healthcare)</b>, <b>Data Science</b>, <b>Biomedical Informatics/NLP</b>. <br>
            <p>I believe Data Science allows me to express my curiosity in ways I'd never imagine. The coolest thing in Data Science is that I see data not as numbers but as an <b>opportunity (business problem)</b>, <b>insights(predictive modelling\stats and data wrangling)</b>, and <b>improvement (metrics).</b></p>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <center><p> I like to be at the intersection of research and industry.  </p></center>
        <hr>
        <p>Things that I value:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Quality Work</b>
          <li> <b>Innovation and Risk Taking</b>
          <li> <b>Passion and Work Ethic</b>
          <li> <b>Humility</b>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy watching biographical, SciFi movies and reading companies financial reports.<br><br>
